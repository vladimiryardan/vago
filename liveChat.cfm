        <p>Live chat enables you to have real-time conversations. Its quick, convenient and customers love it, 100x faster than any other digital service channel. 
		Customer service is essential to a successful business. As companies compete for the loyalty of their customers, they have to create a relationship built with 
		trust and excellent service to keep them from transferring to another brand. This can also be one of the companys biggest marketing strategy. With the good feedback, 
		the company can earn so much more customers than they expected regardless of the price of their product. Consumers will choose to stick to a product or a company that 
		gives excellent customer service even if the price of the commodity is high.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>One of the best mode of customer service is through live chat.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Live chat is real time. This means that consumers can reach out instantly for help and have their problems solved right away anywhere in the world. As we know, there are more irate customers 
		who are looking for an instant fix to their problem. With a live chat support, customers no longer have to wait on a long queue of calls or wait for 24 hours to get a 
		response from an email inquiry. Live chat enables you to greet your customers proactively, which can also increase your company’s credibility as they can chat with a 
		Human instantly which is a good thing on both sides making a sale a lot easier. Most importantly it increases the effectiveness of your marketing effort. Imagine if a 
		customer visits your website, window shopping, checking what you can offer. Instead of them spending more time on searching through your page about your products, they 
		can just use the live chat and ask the agent right away to inquire. As I mentioned earlier, to keep your customers loyalty, you have to create a relationship with your consumers. 
		Live chat taps into the customer’s pain points. It is essential that the consumers feel that you are sincere with the desire to assist them. Because at the end of the day, Customer 
		satisfaction is what’s important. The quality of your service and your product will be the deciding points for the customers to stay with your company. That’s what live chat does, 
		you can understand the needs of your customer which leads to building their trust as they know that whenever they have any inquiries or problems, the solution is just a click away.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>To help you get a better understanding of how much customers appreciate access to live chat, consider the eDigital Customer Service Benchmark survey of 2000 consumers that found that 
		live chat had the highest customer satisfaction levels at 73%, as compared to 61% for email support and only 44% for traditional phone support.</p>
        
        <img src="images/pieChart.jpg" class="img" alt="" width="100%"/>
       
        <p>With numbers like these, it’s easy to see why customers return to businesses that provide live chat. Customers feel more confident doing business with companies that make support easy, 
        hassle free and instantaneous. In fact, a consumer research study from Oracle found that 90% of customers said the “Live Chat” button gives them confidence that they can get help if they 
        need it.</p>
        
        <img src="images/progressBar.jpg"  class="img" alt="" width="100%" style="padding-left:100px; padding-bottom:50px;"/>
        
        <p>Companies from major banks to small e-commerce stores now use live chat software to better service their customers and improve response times. So, it’s no surprise that 33% of consumers 
        now expect to see live chat offered on every website.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Having Live chat is also a great opportunity to improve customer support and provide a memorable customer experience on your website. That’s why customers prefer using live chat.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>According to eDigital’s customer service benchmark, live chat has the highest satisfaction levels for any customer service channel, with 73%, compared with 61% for email and 44% for phone.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The reason for live chat’s high satisfaction levels are due to “the efficiency and immediacy of the experience”, says Kirk Parsons, a Senior Director at Market Research company, J.D. Power.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Sure, you can offer traditional ways for people to contact you, but why not communicate with your customers in a channel that they prefer? By doing so, you will retain more customers.</p>
