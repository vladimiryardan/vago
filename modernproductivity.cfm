    		Despite bold visions and big plans, it's all too easy for entrepreneurs to become bogged down 
    		by the mundane tasks involved in building a successful enterprise. Even when you put in long 
    		hours and personal sacrifice, it can be a struggle to get everything done. This is often the 
    		turning point that determines the success or failure of a start-up venture. Will you adapt and 
    		delegate effectively, or will you burn out as a one-person show?
    	</h5>
		<br>
    	<h5>
    		In any company, there are a few critical tasks which can't be ignored but can distract 
    		entrepreneurs from the work they do best. This is especially true for small companies or 
    		start-ups who are not ready to hire full-time support staff.
    	</h5>
    	<br>
    	<h5>
    		A virtual assistant (VA) can come to the rescue. It's becoming common to hire an individual 
    		who works on your behalf from a remote location, taking care of the crucial tasks that could 
    		easily be done more efficiently by someone else, leaving you free to do higher-level work.
    	</h5>	
		<br>
    	<h5>
    		A virtual assistant can handle everything from answering emails to developing your marketing 
    		strategy. Here's why it's time to consider hiring one of your own.
    	</h5>
    	<br>
    	
    	<h4>
    	<strong>
    		1. VAs Work Within Your Budget
    	</strong>
    	</h4>
    	<br>
    	
    	<h5>
    		You know you need help, but you're not ready to hire a full-time administrative employee. 
    		There's a great degree of flexibility with virtual assistants which makes hiring a possibility 
    		for business owners. Establish what you can afford to pay, then find a professional who will 
    		work within those parameters. You don't have to pay benefits or get locked into a long-term 
    		contract. They can work on their own time, or establish a routine which works well with your 
    		office hours and schedule.
    	</h5>
 		<br>
 		<h4>
 			<strong>
 			2. They Can Fill Multiple Roles
 			</strong>
 		</h4>
 		
 		
    	<h5>
    		Maybe you need more basic or specific help, such as a receptionist or someone to update Excel 
    		files. Perhaps you would benefit from higher-level support, such as a virtual business manager 
    		capable of creating the processes and forms that your growing company needs. VAs can also be 
    		personal assistants, managing a mix of business and personal tasks. Whatever support you need, 
    		there's a virtual assistant who can help.
    	</h5>
    	
    	<h4>
 			<strong>
 				3. They Help You Stay Connected With Customers
 			</strong>
 		</h4>
    	
    	<h5>
    		It's a 24/7 world, and in business, two of the most time-sensitive tasks are responding to 
    		customer communications and handling your social media presence. It's critical to devote the 
    		resources necessary to stay on top of both. If a customer reaches out to you either by email 
    		or in a post on your company's social media page, you need to respond immediately, not when it 
    		comes to your attention a week later. Having a person dedicated to serving as the social media 
    		eyes and ears of your company can help you protect your brand and stay responsive to your 
    		client base.
    	</h5>
    	
    	<br>
    	
    	<h4>
 			<strong>
 				4. They Bring Valuable Skill Sets to Your Company
 			</strong>
 		</h4>
 		
    	<h5>
    		Some VAs have specific areas of expertise such as marketing, writing, social media, HR 
    		functions or bookkeeping. When hiring a VA, whether through an agency or on an individual 
    		basis, do so with an understanding of the experience and abilities you need most to ensure you 
    		get a good fit. Be realistic; while you may get lucky with someone who can do it all, it's not 
    		likely you'll find one person to do the job of several people, crafting emails, basic 
    		administrative tasks, developing engaging online content and managing your books.
    	</h5>
    	<br>
    	
    	<h4>
 			<strong>
 				5. VAs Allow You to Delegate
 			</strong>
 		</h4><br>
 		
    	<h5>
    		Small business owners are (understandably) used to doing everything themselves, though this 
    		strategy wears thin when you're putting in 100-hour work weeks. Working with a VA lets you 
    		exercise your delegating muscles, a talent that will serve you well as your business grows. 
    		Start by developing a thorough job description. The clearer you can state your needs, the more 
    		successful the experience will be for both of you. Like anything else, you get out what you 
    		put in, so it will require an initial investment of time, thought and training to hand work 
    		over. However, this up-front investment will provide more freedom to do the things that only 
    		you can do.
    	</h5>
    	<br>
    	
    	<h4>
 			<strong>
 				6. They'll Grow With Your Company
 			</strong>
 		</h4><br>
 		
    	<h5>
    		You may start a VA with tasks like data entry, managing your email inbox or making travel 
    		arrangements, but as they succeed in those tasks, they may be ready to take on more 
    		responsibility. This is a great way to test-drive support staff and identify people who can 
    		develop into key players for your business.
