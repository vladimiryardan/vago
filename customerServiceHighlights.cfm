    		Customer Satisfaction is addressed as a strategic business development tool. Customer 
    		satisfaction
    		does have a positive effect on a company's profitability. Satisfied customers form the 
    		foundation of
    		any successful business as it leads to repeat purchase, brand loyalty and positive word of the 
    		mouth.
    		Satisfied customers are most likely to share their experiences with other people. Customer
    		satisfaction characterizes itself by a high degree of word of the mouth.

    		One of the very best way to endear oneself to a customer is to surface a potential problem and
    		come armed with a ready-made solution, give them the opportunity to experience life as one of 
    		your
    		family. As a result, they will feel highly valued, share great insights and help you improve 
    		your
    		customer service.
    	</p>
    	
    	<br>
    	
    	<p>
    		Customer service is important to every business! Without customers, no business can survive.
    		Customers will go where they are treated fairly and with respect, and even spend more money at
    		such a business. Customer service goes a long way these days, and sets you apart from your
    		competitors in a price-dominated marketplace. Exceptional and consistent customer service is 
    		what
    		a business more successful than the other.
    	</p>
    	
    	<br>
    	
    	<p>
    		Effective customer service involves meeting or exceeding customer's needs. However, customer
    		service is not just about what you do for your customers, it also concerns how the service is 
    		carried
    		out individually. It is clear that customer satisfaction can be defined as an overall customer 
    		attitude
    		towards a service provider, or an emotional reaction to the difference between what customers
    		anticipate and what they receive, regarding the fulfilment of some need, goal or desire.
    	</p>
    	
    	<br>
    	
    	<p>
    		Today, we are seeing that, more often than not, exceptional customer service makes the 
    		infrequent
    		issues not as painful as they once were. Our customers expect and deserve the best, and
    		consistently excellent customer service helps to generate not only customer retention and 
    		renewals,
    		but also referrals.
    	</p>
    	
    	<br>
    	
    	<p>
    		All in all, if you take time with your customers, actively listen to them, and make a solid 
    		effort to
    		resolve their problems, this will likely come back around in a positive way.
