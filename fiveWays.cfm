					Voice over IP (VoIP) isn’t a new concept—it has been around for more than two decades—but 
					today’s VoIP is easier to use and even more dependable. You may be thinking that your current 
					business
					phone system works fine. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it, right? Or, maybe you’re worried about 
					the cost or down time or that VoIP is too complicated. VoIP is an investment of time and money, 
					but
					isn’t keeping up with the competition the best way for your business to be more productive, 
					attract customers, and increase profits? 
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					Five signs can tell you that your business is ready to invest in VoIP: 
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						- Your business is growing or expanding. 
					</li>
					<li>
						- You’re paying too much. 
					</li>
					<li>
						- You have a large remote workforce. 
					</li>
					<li>
						- Customer complaints have increased. 
					</li>
					<li>
						- Your voicemail inbox is always full. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Many businesses delayed switching to VoIP fearing that it was too complicated or too expensive. 
					Why not take a closer look now? 
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					<b>
						Your Business Is Growing
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditionally, businesses used a private branch exchange (PBX) telephone system. PBX systems 
					have a limited number of ports and lines, however, which means that to add lines as you add 
					staff,
					you must purchase new equipment. With VoIP, the system is cloud-based, meaning that there’s no 
					need for extra equipment as your business grows. 
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>
					<b>
						You’re Paying Too Much
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Between office equipment, mobile devices, and fees for international calls, companies may not 
					realize how much they’re really spending on communications. After taking a closer look, many 
					businesses
					realize that a switch to VoIP could result in significant savings. VoIP can not only save you 
					money on international calls, but the bring your own device plans can reduce mobile device 
					costs, as well.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>
					<b>
						Large Remote Workforce
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Employees no longer need to work from the office. More and more of today’s workforce hold 
					flexible freelance positions, and this number will continue to grow. Problems can occur if your 
					company’s remote
					workers have difficulty connecting to the office or clients, so it’s essential that you 
					establish and maintain an effective line of communication with remote staff. VoIP helps ensure 
					that remote workers using
					home offices or mobile devices are connected as if they were sitting at the desk next to you. 
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					<b>
						Increased Customer Complaints
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a time when the only way your customer could reach you was by phone. Now, with social 
					media and email, reaching you by phone is not the first or the only option, but it is still 
					critical to ensure
					that they can. If customers can’t get through, are kept on hold, or must explain their 
					situation repeatedly, they get annoyed. That’s a sign that it’s time to upgrade to VoIP. 
					Upgrading may not solve all your
					problems overnight, but it will help you address your customers’ issues and complaints in a 
					more concise, timely manner. 
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					<b>
					No Room in the Inbox
					</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If your voicemail is full, then the next caller who wants to leave a message is unable to do 
					so. That can result in lost customers or business deals. VoIP systems offer tools and features 
					that allow you to
					ensure your inbox never overflows. With voicemail-to-email, .mp3 conversion, and various 
					storage options, VoIP helps you manage your voicemails more efficiently, preventing missed 
					calls and lost business.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					Your employees probably update their personal mobile phones regularly to keep up with 
					technology. Why, then, wouldn’t you do the same for your business? Taking a closer look, you 
					may find the signs staring at you,
					telling you it’s time to invest in VoIP. The sooner you do, the sooner your company will see a 
					positive return.
