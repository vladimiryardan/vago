        			A lot of business experts will tell you to invest in data, tools, statistical analysis, 
        			and market research, if you want to stay on top of the lead game. However, it is easy to 
        			neglect the fact that without a team of highly persuasive agents, all of your efforts 
        			would be wasted. Hence, instead of concentrating on the technicalities, you have to make 
        			sure that your people will do anything to get that potential customer.

        		consider your existing customers as possible resources too! Getting referrals from your

            		contribute to the success or failure of such goals. Technology has truly upgraded our 
            		standards in advertising, marketing and sales. It is for this reason that many 
            		business are focused in data management. However, we need to consider that the real 
            		essence of the operation lies in the connection between the potential client and the 
            		representatives on the other end of the phone line. After all, what creates a loyal 
            		customer is the trust that they give to the person they spoke with and the great 
            		experience that came with it.
