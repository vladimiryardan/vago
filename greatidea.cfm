    	<h5>
    		Business owners who have too many responsibilities, but unable or unwilling to employ a 
    		full-time employee are seeking help from virtual assistants.
    	</h5>
	
    	<br>
    	<h4>
    	<strong>
    		Here are the top three reasons why.
    	</strong>
    	</h4>
    	<br>
    	<h5>
    		There are many virtual assistants who are more dedicated and committed to giving quality work. 
    		Virtual Assistants are very productive and always value their clients. They also give the best 
    		service since they know that their salary is totally dependent on the positive performance of 
    		their tasks.
    	</h5>
	
    	<h5>
    		Virtual Assistants use their own equipment and office supplies. Most Virtual Assistants are 
    		from companies that offer VA services. This means that they use their own office equipment. 
    		Business owners do not have to purchase additional equipment and other office supplies because 
    		virtual Assistants are already provided by their company.
    	</h5>
    	
    	<h5>
    		Virtual Assistants pay their taxes and benefits. One major advantage of hiring Virtual 
    		Assistants is that business owners do not need to pay taxes or create an employee benefits 
    		package just like what they do to their regular employees. Since VAs are independent 
    		contractors, they are solely responsible for their own benefits and taxes.
    		Furthermore, businesses that offer virtual assistant services have the opportunity to grow 
    		their company. IT companies can provide virtual assistants to those businesses abroad that 
    		want to delegate tasks to professionals via the cloud. This way, businesses offering virtual 
    		assistant services can have additional income helping them to expand and to match the rising 
    		demand of Virtual Assistants. As a matter of fact, studies show that one in two businesses is 
    		predicted to hire assistant online by 2020 making the virtual assistant job a long-term 
    		business opportunity.
    	</h5>
    
    	<h5>
    		Those businesses that have Virtual Assistants who are expert in search engine optimization 
    		(SEO) and social media marketing are more likely to be successful. Many companies nowadays 
    		constantly strive to boost the number of followers on their social media profiles and their 
    		search result rankings.
    	</h5>
 		<br>
 		<h4>
 			<strong>
 				Do you want to be a Virtual Assistant?
 			</strong>
 		</h4>
 		
 		
    	<h5>
    		Be it personal or professional, if you are a highly organized person with experience as a 
    		personal assistant and has good communication skills, being a Virtual Assistant is the best 
    		job for you.
    	</h5>
		
    	<h5>
    		For you to stand out as a virtual assistant, you need to specialize your services rather than 
    		working as a "Jack of all Trades". There are some specializations that you could consider such 
    		as working as a proofreader, social media assistant, virtual writer, virtual researcher, 
    		website designer, website developer and more!
    	</h5>
    
    	<h5>
    		The Virtual Assistant market is growing, if you do not want to be left behind by your 
    		competitors or you want to offer your services virtually, start your Virtual Assistant 
    		business now.
